# EyesightTest
An embedded system that uses lidar and LCD screen to test the eyesight.

This project aims to build an eyesight test device prototype, which measures the eyesight in a traditional way. Namely, the device uses a LCD screen to display the symbol “E” instead of an actual chart, and uses a LiDAR and servo to detect the hand position and determine whether the answer is correct. 
The motivation for this project is to implement an embedded system that can solve a real-world problem. Nowadays, an embedded system can solve a problem in an efficient way with a relatively low cost. This project explores the implementation of a basic level embedded system that can help us familiar with the usage of embedded programming skills such as UART, LiDAR, PWM and ADC.
